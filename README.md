Module 11 Express.js

Module 11 Challenge Creating A Note Taker!

## Introduction

For this assignment, I built an application using Node.js that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end while saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a Note Taker using Express.js that features the following:

When the user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.

When the user clicks on the save button, the new note that has been entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.

When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, the note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.

When the user clicks on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.

## References
After cloning the starter code, I began the process of completing this assignment.

To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 11-Express Class Activity Files as references:

"01-Ins_Setup" 

"07-Ins_GET-Fetch"

"08-Stu_Inheritance"

"13-Ins_POST-Requests"

"17-Ins_POST-Fetch"

"21-Ins_Modular-Routing"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/danielolvera21/note-taker"

"https://github.com/EmilyNecciai/duly-noted"

"https://github.com/Krenbot/note-taker"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGMdgWCDgFM"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in the server.js, and both index.js files from the routes folder to see what each specific block of code accomplished. Addtionally, I created a separate helpers folder in order to generate random ID's that were needed for the Note Taker.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria for our specific assignment. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
